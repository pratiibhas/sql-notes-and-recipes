/* It is not valid in SQL (or, formally speaking, in mathematics) to compute logarithms
of values less than or equal to zero. If you have such values in your tables, you need to
avoid passing those invalid values to SQLâ€™s LN function. 


The solution takes advantage of the fact that you can multiply two numbers by:
1. Computing their respective natural logarithms
2. Summing those logarithms
3. Raising the result to the power of the mathematical constant e (using the EXP
function)*/
