-- 3.5 Retrieving Rows from One Table That Do Not
-- Correspond to Rows in Another

/*You want to find rows that are in one table that do not have a match in another table,
for two tables that have common keys. For example, you want to find which depart‚Äê
ments have no employees. The result set should be the following:
DEPTNO       DNAME         LOC
---------- -------------- -------------
40          OPERATIONS     BOSTON*/
use practice;
select * from dept d
left join emp_table e
on d.deptno=e.deptno
where e.deptno is null;

-- here difference between left join and using exists is that we can return many more columns 
SELECT *
FROM dept d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM emp_table e
    WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
);

-- For large datasets, NOT EXISTS is usually faster. üöÄ
-- For smaller datasets, LEFT JOIN is often easier to understand. üòä
